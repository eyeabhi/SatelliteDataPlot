# SatelliteDataPlot
A basic script to read data from NetCDF-4 files and generate a contour plot. It builds a 2-D histogram of temperature first, then plots its contour.

NetCDF files stores sensor measurement data collected at various satellites. Data is freely available at http://saber.gats-inc.com/browse_data.php .
This program reads a bunch of NetCDF files and generates a contour plot of the temperature, varying latitude, longitude or altitude in the x and y axes.
